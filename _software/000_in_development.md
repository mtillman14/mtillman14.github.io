## [SVGPub](https://github.com/mtillman14/SVGPub)

Tools to manipulate SVG files for publication-ready figures.

## [ResearchOS](https://github.com/ResearchOS/ResearchOS)

A suite of tools to facilitate reproducible and efficient data analysis. 

Currently, there are four tools in this suite:
1. [base-dag](https://github.com/ResearchOS/base-dag) Implementation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that the rest of the tools utilize.
2. [dagpiler](https://github.com/ResearchOS/dagpiler) Compile a DAG from configuration files. Also provides a mechanism to create configuration files from a template.
3. [dataset-builder](https://github.com/ResearchOS/dataset-builder) Register a dataset from metadata.
4. [dagrunner](https://github.com/ResearchOS/dagrunner) Leverage the prior three tools to execute the DAG.
