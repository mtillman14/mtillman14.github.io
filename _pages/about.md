I currently work at Shirley Ryan Ability Lab in Chicago, IL USA studying whether electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can improve gait symmetry in stroke patients.

I attained my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering in 2024 from Stevens Institute of Technology. My dissertation focused on whole-body biomechanics of balance and momentum control during walking and 90 degree turning in healthy young and older adults. My 2019 M.S. degree from Purdue University focused on the effect of anticipation on stability.

My long term research interests lie at the intersection of motor control and biomechanics. I am especially interested in the control of sudden, unanticipated movement.

I also focus on developing software tools to increase the pace of research. Check out the [Software](http://mitchelltillman.com/software/) page to see existing and in-development software projects.
