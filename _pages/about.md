I currently work at [Shirley Ryan Ability Lab](https://www.sralab.org/research/labs/max-nader-rto) in Chicago, IL USA studying whether electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can improve gait symmetry in stroke patients.

I attained my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering in 2024 from Stevens Institute of Technology working with [Dr. Antonia Zaferiou](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/azaferio). My dissertation focused on whole-body biomechanics of balance and momentum control during walking and 90 degree turning in healthy young and older adults. My 2019 M.S. degree from Purdue University working with [Dr. Satyajit Ambike](https://www.purdue.edu/hhs/hk/Biomechanics-MotorBehavior/about/dr-satyajit-ambike/) focused on the effect of anticipation on control of stability.

My long term research interests lie at the intersection of motor control and biomechanics in diverse, everyday movements. I am especially interested in the control of sudden, unanticipated movement, and how movement control relates to motor function and pain.

I also focus on developing software tools to increase the pace of research. Check out the [Software](http://mitchelltillman.com/software/) page to see existing and in-development software projects.
