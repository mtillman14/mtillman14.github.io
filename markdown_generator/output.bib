  abstract = {Generation and regulation (control) of linear and angular momentum is a challenge during turning while walking which may be exacerbated by age-related changes. In healthy older adults, little is known about how momentum is controlled during turns, especially within each phase of gait. Each phase of gait affords unique mechanical contexts to control momenta and regulate balance. In healthy young adults, we found that the transverse-plane linear and angular momenta generation strategies observed within specific phases of gait during straight-line gait were also used during turns. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether healthy older adults shared similar momentum control strategies specific to each gait phase during straight-line gait and turns.},

  abstract = {Turning while walking is ubiquitous and requires linear and angular momenta generation to redirect the body's trajectory and rotate towards the new direction of travel. This study examined strategies that healthy young adults used during each gait phase to generate transverse-plane momenta during pre-planned and late-cued 90{$^\circ$} turns. During leftward turns, we expected that momenta would be generated most during the gait phases known to generate leftward linear and angular momenta during straight line gait. We found distinct roles of gait phases towards generating momenta during turns that partially supported our hypotheses. Supporting one hypothesis, the change in transverse-plane angular momentum and average moment were greater during double support with the left foot in front vs. other gait phases. Also, the change in leftward linear momentum and average leftward force were greater during right single support vs. other gait phases during straight-line gait and late-cued turns. However, during pre-planned turns, the average leftward force was not significantly greater during right single support vs. other gait phases. Overall, transverse-plane angular momentum generation during turns is similar to its generation during straight-line gait, suggesting that healthy young adults can leverage momenta control strategies used during straight-line gait during turns.},

  abstract = {This study evaluated frontal-plane dynamic balance control during 90{$^\circ$} left turns while walking. Ten healthy young adults performed straight-line gait, pre-planned turns, and turns cued visually (late-cued turns). We quantified rotational balance control via the range of frontal-plane angular momentum (Hf) about the center of mass (COM), and the relative positioning of the COM and the feet using the horizontal distance from the COM to the lateral edge of the base of support (lateral distance) and the mediolateral margin of stability (MOSml). We hypothesized that the Hf range would increase and the lateral distance and MOSml minima would decrease during each turn type vs. straight-line gait and during late-cued vs. pre-planned turns. We found that the range of Hf was significantly greater during each turn type vs. straight-line gait and during late-cued vs. pre-planned turns. Also, the lateral distance minima were significantly smaller during turns vs. straight-line gait, and during pre-planned vs. late-cued turns. Our hypotheses about MOSml were partially supported because the MOSml minima patterns were specific to right or left steps and were not significantly different between straight-line gait and pre-planned turns overall, but the right step's MOSml minima were more negative during late-cued vs. pre-planned turns and between either turn and straight-line gait. Finally, we observed slower gait speeds, fewer footfalls, shorter turn phase duration, and different turn strategies used during late-cued vs. pre-planned turns. Overall, these findings reveal multifaceted control of frontal-plane balance during turns encountered during everyday mobility.},

  abstract = {In this study, we explored the effects of a motion capture-based real-time sonified biofeedback system on balance. We present the initial efforts towards developing a task-independent optical motion capture based real-time balance sonification system. Five healthy young adults (two female; 24 {\textpm} 2.65 years) stood on one foot before and during listening to sonified biofeedback that expressed information in real-time about the state of their balance. In two of five participants, interacting with our sonified biofeedback system resulted in increased "Margin of Stability", a metric indicative of how well the body center of mass is supported by a person's stance. This result indicates our system's initial promise towards training balance strategies. Qualitatively, the participants who increased the Margin of Stability during sonification reported enjoying the experience more and were more aware of changes in their behavior, compared to those who did not increase their Margin of Stability. We also learned that our sonification system has design elements that are incompatible with the stationary tasks in the present study, which will inform our next iteration of sonification design. Future work will examine sonifying balance in dynamic balance tasks, with the goal of aiding clinical balance training.},

  abstract = {The authors examined how the stability of the current total isometric force (FT) produced by four fingers is influenced by previous and expected voluntary changes in FT. The authors employed the synergy index obtained from the across-trial uncontrolled manifold analysis to quantify the stability of FT. The authors compared two tasks with similar histories of FT changes; one in which participants expected changes in FT in the future, and one in which they expected no changes in FT. The stability of FT was lower in the former task, indicating the existence of a novel type of anticipatory synergy adjustment. Disparate histories of FT changes yield inconsistent changes in stability, driven by individual differences in the covariation in the finger forces that leave FT invariant. Future research should focus on exploring these individual differences to better understand how previous and expected behavior changes influence the stability of the current motor behavior.},

  abstract = {Anticipatory synergy adjustment (ASA) is a feed-forward control mechanism that describes a continuous decrease in the stability of the current motor state beginning about 150 ms prior to a state transition. Recently, we described an associated phenomenon in which the system stability was reduced solely in response to a cue that generates an expectation of a state change, independent of whether the state change actually occurs. Both phenomena are of the same kind (stability reduction), but evoked by distinct antecedent conditions. Since, logically, cuing for movement must occur before the initiation of that movement, we named this new phenomenon 'Stage-1 ASA' and rechristened the well-established version 'Stage-2 ASA'. Here, we used a four-finger, isometric force production task to explore (1) the effect of healthy aging on Stage-1 ASA, and (2) if Stage-1 ASA resulted in a more rapid state change. Young and older adult participants produced 10\% of their maximal force when they did not expect to produce any change in the force, and when they expected to change their force in an unknown direction and at an unknown time. In the latter condition, the 10\% constant-force phase was followed by a choice reaction time task, in which the participants rapidly changed their force to follow a moving target presented on a computer monitor. Both young and older adults displayed equivalent amount of Stage-1 ASA. This was driven by a 42\% reduction in finger-force variability in young adults. In contrast, it was driven by a 38\% increase in finger-force variability in older adults. We speculate that the reduction in finger force variability assists the young adults in rapid state changes via two mechanisms: (1) the finger forces occupy a restricted set of states that are optimal for quick state transitions, and (2) lower variability during steady state translates into lower self-motion during state transition. Self-motion is the covariation between finger forces that fails to change the total force. The older adults are unable to adopt this strategy, and the increase in finger-force variability arises from (1) the adoption of an alternative strategy of destabilizing the attractor associated with the current state to facilitate state transitions and (2) the inability to coordinate multiple finger forces. Finally, older adults displayed longer reaction times than young adults, but a clear relation between Stage-1 ASA and consequent behavioral benefit in terms of reduced reaction time remained elusive.},

  abstract = {A motor system configured to maximize the stability of its current state cannot dexterously transition between states. Yet, we routinely resolve the stability-dexterity conflict and rapidly change our current behavior without allowing it to become unstable before the desired transition. The phenomenon called anticipatory synergy adjustment (ASA) partly describes how the central nervous system handles this conflict. ASA is a continuous decrease in the stability of the current motor state beginning 150--400 ms before a rapid state transition accomplished using redundant sets of motor inputs (more input variables than task-specific output vari-ables). So far, ASAs have been observed only when the timing of the upcoming transition is known. We utilized a multifinger, isometric force-production task to demonstrate that compared with a condition where no state transition is expected, the stability of the current state is lower by {\textasciitilde}12\% when a participant is cued to make a transition, even when the nature and timing of that transition are unknown. This result (stage 1 ASA) is distinct from its traditional version (stage 2 ASA), and it describes early destabilization that occurs solely in response to the expectation to move. Stage 2 ASA occurs later, only if the timing of the transition is known sufficiently in advance. Stage 1 ASA lasts much longer ({\textasciitilde}1.5 s) and may scale in response to the perceived difficulty of the upcoming task. Therefore, this work reveals a much refined view of the processes that underlie the resolution of the stability-dexterity conflict. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY We compared the stability of multifinger, isometric force-production tasks for trials in which force changes of unknown direction and timing were expected with trials in which there was no expectation of any force change. Mere expectation of a change caused the stability of the current motor state to drop. This novel result provides a much refined view of the processes that facilitate dexterous switching between motor states.},
